        "\n",
        "Ans- The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: This involves hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency by allowing the focus on high-level functionalities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as an object. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance allows a new class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent or superclass). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be defined in multiple forms, enabling the same operation to behave differently on different classes (method overriding and method overloading).\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: Composition entails constructing complex objects from simpler ones by allowing classes to contain instances of other classes as fields. This enables a \"has-a\" relationship, providing a way to build complex types by combining simpler ones.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans-  In Python, instance methods and class methods are two different types of methods that are used in object-oriented programming. Here's a breakdown of the differences between them:\n",
        "\n",
        "Instance Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "Definition: Instance methods are functions defined in a class that operate on instances of that class (i.e., objects). They can access and modify the attributes of the particular instance (object) they belong to.\n",
        "\n",
        "Invocation: They are called on an instance of the class and take self as the first parameter, which refers to the specific instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Used for operations that require access to instance-specific data.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Methods\n",
        "Definition: Class methods are functions defined in a class that operate on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. They can modify class state that applies across all instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Invocation: They are called on the class itself (not on an instance) and take cls (which refers to the class) as the first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use: Often used for factory methods or for methods that need to affect the class level attributes or methods.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, traditional method overloading—where multiple methods of the same name with different parameter types or counts can be defined—is not directly supported as it is in some other programming languages (like Java or C++). Instead, Python allows a flexible approach using default arguments, variable-length arguments, or by implementing custom behavior in a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing Method Overloading in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Default Arguments: We can define a method with default parameter values and handle different cases inside the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using Variable-Length Arguments: We can use *args and **kwargs to pass a variable number of arguments to a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Custom Handling: We can check the type and number of arguments within a single method and perform actions based on those.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Method Overloading using Default Parameters\n",
        "Here’s an example demonstrating how to use default arguments to simulate method overloading:\n",

        "print(result2)  # Output: 15  \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- In Python, access modifiers control the accessibility of class attributes and methods. They help to implement encapsulation by defining how and where certain class members can be accessed. The three types of access modifiers in Python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Public\n",
        "Description: Public members (attributes and methods) are accessible from anywhere in the program, both inside and outside the class. By default, all members in a class are public.\n",
        "Denotation: Public members do not require any special notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "print(obj.public_method())    # Accessible\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Protected\n",
        "Description: Protected members are intended to be accessible only within the class itself and by subclasses (derived classes). They are not meant for access outside these boundaries, but Python does not enforce this strictly.\n",
        "Denotation: Protected members are denoted with a single underscore (_) before the member name.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans-  In Python, inheritance allows a class (derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (base class). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes. There are several types of inheritance in Python:\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "Description: A derived class inherits from multiple base classes. This allows the derived class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one base class.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class Vehicle:  \n",
        "     def drive(self):  \n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python is the order in which base classes are looked up when searching for a method in a class hierarchy. MRO is particularly important in the context of multiple inheritance, where a class can inherit from multiple base classes, and it determines the sequence in which methods are inherited.\n",
        "\n",
        "How MRO Works\n",
        "\n",
        "When a method is called on an object, Python checks the object’s class for the method. If it’s not found in that class, Python looks at the base classes in a specific order, following the MRO. The main algorithms used to determine MRO are C3 Linearization (or C3 superclass linearization), which ensures that classes are checked in a consistent order while maintaining the order of inheritance.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans- The Diamond Problem is a common issue that arises in multiple inheritance scenarios in object-oriented programming, particularly when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. This can lead to ambiguity in the method resolution order (MRO) because it's unclear which superclass method should be called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of the Diamond Problem\n",
        "Consider the following class hierarchy:\n",
        "\n",
        "     A  \n",
        "    / \\\n",
        "   B   C  \n",
        "    \\ /  \n",
        "     D  \n",
        "Here, class D inherits from both classes B and C, which both inherit from class A. If there is a method in class A that is overridden in both classes B and C, and an instance of class D calls that method, it is ambiguous which version (from B or C) should be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python's Resolution of the Diamond Problem\n",
        "Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) that is based on the C3 linearization algorithm. This algorithm creates a linear order of classes to ensure that every class appears only once and that each class’s parent classes are considered in a consistent manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we call a method on an object, Python determines the method resolution order by following these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with the class of the instance: Inherit from the child class and move up the hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Follow the MRO: Python provides a method called mro() which can be used to view the order in which Python will search for methods. We can also access it via the __mro__ attribute of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Search for the method: The search for the method will proceed according to the MRO until the method is found.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example Implementation\n",

        "d = D()  \n",
        "d.method()  # Output: Method from B  \n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, when we call d.method(), Python checks the MRO of class D, which is D -> B -> C -> A. Therefore, it finds the method defined in B first and calls it.\n",
